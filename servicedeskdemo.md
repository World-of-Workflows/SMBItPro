## Response

Hi Margot,

Thank you for reaching out to us. It sounds like your display settings might be causing the zoomed-in effect on your Surface. Let's go through a few steps to adjust this:

1. **Check Display Settings:**
   - Right-click anywhere on the desktop (but not on an icon) and select **Display settings**.
   - Scroll down to **Scale and layout**. Ensure the **Scale** is set to 100% (or something that looks normal for you).
   - If itâ€™s set higher (like 125% or 150%), change it back to 100%.

2. **Check Magnifier Tool:**
   - Press the **Windows key** and **+** (plus) together to open the Magnifier. If this is active, it could cause the screen to zoom in.
   - To turn it off, press the **Windows key** and **Esc** together.

3. **Resolution Check:**
   - In the same **Display settings** window, scroll up and check the **Display resolution**. It should typically be set to the recommended setting for your Surface (usually something like 2736 x 1824).
   - If it's not on the recommended resolution, select it and see if that fixes the issue.

After trying these, your screen should be back to normal. Let me know if you're still having trouble!

Best regards,
